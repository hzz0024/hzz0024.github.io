### Levene's equation for delta_p

We calculate the value of delta P after selection in one generation under Levene's model, as a function of initial allele frequency (P) and the strength of selection (s). For each s, it will return the delta_p with P ranging from 0-1. Here P is a the vector of allele frequencies before within-generation selection. 

```R
Levene <- function(s)
  {
  P <- seq(0,1,0.01)
  DpLev <- (s*(P-(P^2)))/(1-(2*s*P)+s) # original code provided by Dr. Gagnaire
  }
```

### Modification of original code

However, when I went through the code, I found a potential bug in this function. 

As indicated by Howard Levene in the paper, Wi and Vi are the adaptive values of AA and A'A' individuals relative to AA' in the i-th inche. With that, we assume fitness of AA as 1+s, the fitness of Aa as 1, and the fitness of aa as 1-s. With this assumption, the selection has an antagonistic and symmetrical effect on the fitness of homozygotes.

Below is how I obtain the modified function for Levene's model

```sh
Wi= 1+s # adaptive values of AA
Vi = 1-s # adaptive values of A'A' 

# Substitute Wi and Vi into equation 1 in Levene's paper

Upper part: 

  (1-Vi) + (Wi+Vi-2)q 
= (1-(1-s)) + ((1+s) + (1-s)-2)q 
= s

Down part:

  Vi + 2(1-Vi)q + (Wi+Vi-2)q^ 
= (1-s) + 2(1-(1-s))q + (1+s+1-s-2)q^ 
= 1-s + 2sq

The whole equation will be:

(q*(1-q)*s)/(1 + 2sq -s)

or 

DpLev <- (s*(P-(P^2)))/(1+(2*s*P)-s)
```

Not sure if I am right or not. I need to ask Dr. Gagnaire for help.
