### Equation for delta p

We calculate the value of delta P after selection in one generation under Levene's moldel, as a function of initial allele frequency before selection and the strength of selection. The fitness of AA is 1+s, the fitness of Aa is 1 and the fitness of aa is 1-s. Therefore, allele A determines genotypes' fitness. Additively, and selection has an antagonistic and symmetrical effect on the fitness of homozygotes.

Levene is a function to calculate the delta_p with specified selection coefficient. For each s, it will return the delta_p with p ranging from 0-1. -P is a internal parameter that produce the vector of allele frequencies in the generation (i.e. in the larval pool) before selection 

```R
Levene <- function(s)
  {
  P <- seq(0,1,0.01)
  DpLev <- (s*(P-(P^2)))/(1-(2*s*P)+s) # original code
  
  DpLev <- s*P*(1-P)/(1 + 2*s*P - s) # code modified by HG
  }
```
