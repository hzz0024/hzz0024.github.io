This is an initial attempt for the discovery of tran-specific polymorphism (TSP) in oyster species. A simple definition of TSP is the positions that are polymorphic in both *C. virginica* and *C. gigas*.

I will start by literature review, trying to find some technical difficults of TSP discovery.

*"Because the calling of trans-specific SNPs (tsSNPs) is particularly sensitive to mismapping errors in repetitive sequences, we applied a set of stringent filters, resulting in 74% of the C. rubella reference genome remaining accessible to base calling in both species, with almost half (47%) of the masked sites in the repeat rich pericentromeric regions.
