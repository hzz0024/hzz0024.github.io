This is an initial attempt for the discovery of tran-specific polymorphism (TSP) in oyster species. A simple definition of TSP is the positions that are polymorphic in both *C. virginica* and *C. gigas*.

I will start by literature review, trying to find some technical difficults of TSP discovery.

- Long-term balancing selection drives evolution of immunity genes in Capsella by Koenig et al. 2019. eLIFE

*"Because the calling of trans-specific SNPs (tsSNPs) is particularly sensitive to mismapping errors in repetitive sequences, we applied a set of stringent filters, resulting in 74% of the C. rubella reference genome remaining accessible to base calling in both species, with almost half (47%) of the masked sites in the repeat rich pericentromeric regions. "*


What is the TSP patterns in the context of balancing selection?

- Ecological load and balancing selection i curcumboreal barnacles by Nunez et al. 2020. MBE

*"Balancing selection is expected to produce molecular and phylogenetic footprints not consistent with neutrality (Fijarczyk and Babik 2015). Molecular footprints include: enrichment of old alleles (e.g., trans-species polymorphisms; TSPs), elevated genetic variation (high Ï€), deficit of rare alleles (D > 0),
excess SNPs at medium allele frequencies, reduced divergence around the balanced locus (low FST), as well as the accumulation of non-synonymous variation in the vicinity of balanced polymorphisms, a phenomenon known as sheltered load (Uyenoyama 2005)."
