This post is created to show some complementary results for outliers flanking regions. Here the outliers were previously identified from the Fisher's combined probability test.

|   Test       | fdr < 0.1 | fdr < 0.05| fdr < 0.01| fdr < 0.1 | fdr < 0.05| fdr < 0.01|
|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|              |   Fisher  |   Fisher  |  Fisher   | Z method  | Z method  |  Z method |
|REF-CH-SR-HC  |     11    |  4        |      0    |     41    | 10        |      1    |
|REF-CH-NB-HC  |     31    |  8        |      1    |     32    | 16        |      6    |
|SR-REF-COH-ARN|      0    |  0        |      0    |     20    | 0         |      0    |


Now check the bootstrap outliers,

```sh
Fisher 
# easy - FDR < 0.1 hard - FDR < 0.05

Let us start with chr5:15407830-16927227, an outlier window (with 10K SNP/window for bootstrap) shared by both REF-CH-SR-HC and REF-CH-NB-HC groups in Fisher's approach and shown in the REF-CH-NB-HC result by Z method. In this window, two SNPs have been identified as single-SNP outliers: 5_16551904 and 5_16552716. Specifically, SNP 5_16552716 is also identified as an outlier shared by both groups (e.g. REF-CH-SR-HC and REF-CH-NB-HC) and methods (Fisher and Z methods). In addition, a gene named *actin-depolymerizing factor 1-like* is linked to these two SNPs (spans from 16551175 to 16553910,[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=LOC111134891](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=LOC111134891)). The SNP annotation link is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19TCyi7zKxK7OC6TFrPtCR4DkcgOBqLe20pV2jQw5Jkk/edit?usp=sharing)

- produce dxy plots for each group comparsion. Green zone is the outlier window with 10K SNPs. Red dots are two single-SNP oultiers.
