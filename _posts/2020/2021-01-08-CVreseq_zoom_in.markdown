Below are two draft figures to show the Genomic context and detailed manhattan plots for Fst and heterozygosity differences, as well as genotype patterns in the shared outlier locus on chromosome 2 between high and low salinity samples from Delaware Bay (pink) and Chesapeake Bay (Blue).

The major difference between these two figures are part B. The first one draws spline based on linear regression between x (position) and y (Fst or H-diff), whereas the second one based on mean measured within 1000 bp windows (either Fst or H-diff).
