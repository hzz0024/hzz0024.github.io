#### What is C-score?

C-score is a indice that quantify the repeated observation of convergent adaptation [Yeaman et al 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007717). Here convergence means overlap genetic variation that arises as a product of multiple routs to adaptation [Laruson et al 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2020.04.009). High values of the C-score occur with high repeatability, which means that some constraints exist that limit the number of viable genotypes that can give rise to an adaptive phenotype. 

#### How to obtain C-scores?

A null model hypothesizing that no diversity constraints and all genes potentially give rise to variation and contribute to adaptation is needed C-score calculation. Yeaman et al. used different notation to present different properties of the genomic basis of trait variation (with two species as an example):

- the number of loci in the genome of each species is n<sub>x</sub>, and n<sub>y</sub>, with the number of orthologous loci shared by both species being n<sub>s</sub>;         

- the adaptive trait is controlled by g<sub>x</sub> and g<sub>y</sub> loci in each species, with g<sub>s</sub> shared loci (i.e. the loci in which mutations will give rise to phenotypic variation in the trait, hereafter the “mutational target”); 

- of the g loci that give rise to variation, only a subset have the potential to contribute to adaptation due to the combined effect of all constraints, represented by ga<sub>x</sub> and ga<sub>y</sub>, with ga<sub>s</sub> shared loci (the “effective adaptive target”); 

- in a given bout of adaptation, the number of loci that contribute to adaptation in each lineage is a<sub>x</sub> and a<sub>y</sub>, with a<sub>s</sub> orthologous loci contributing in both lineages.

In practice, we typically have little prior knowledge about which genes have the potential to contribute to either adaptation (ga<sub>s</sub>) or standing variation in the trait (g<sub>s</sub>), but we can draw inferences about how these parameters constrain the diversity of adaptive responses by testing hypotheses and comparing the observed amount of overlap (a<sub>s</sub>) to the amount expected under a given null hypothesis (ā<sub>s</sub>), where the expected amount of overlap is ā<sub>s</sub> = a<sub>x</sub>a<sub>y</sub>/ga<sub>s</sub>.

Multiple methods of C-score estimation have proposed:

1) quantify diversity constraints in pairwise contrasts;        
2) quantify diversity constraints in multiple lineages;           
3) quantify diversity constraints with continuous data (e.g., FST, p-values, Bayes factors);        
4) quantify proportion of the genome that can potentially contribute to adaptation          

#### Simple example

<img src="https://hzz0024.github.io/images/C_score/journal.pgen.1007717.g003.PNG" alt="img" width="800"/>

As shown in the example above, four example datasets are generated to represent either randomly drawn complements of genes with adapted mutations (A) or highly convergent datasets drawn from a smaller (B) or larger (C & D) pool of genes that potentially contribute to trait variation (g<sub>s</sub>), with differing numbers of loci contributing to adaptation. Scenario C is the most constrained, as it exhibits the same amount of overlap as B, but this overlap is drawn from a larger pool of genes so it is less likely to occur by chance.

Both the Cchisq and Chyper indices show the highest scores for scenario C, because it has the smallest probability of occurring by chance if all genes had equal probabilities of contributing to adaptation. The index also identifies scenario C as most constrained in terms of the smallest proportion genes potentially contributing to adaptation. The  index also shows that this proportion is equal for scenarios B & D, despite differences in the probability of the observed repeatabilities occurring by chance (as per the C-scores).

#### Calculating C-scores using R package dgconstraint

The dgconstraint R package provides functions for calculating C-scores [https://github.com/samyeaman/dgconstraint](https://github.com/samyeaman/dgconstraint).

- Installation

```R
library(devtools)
install_github("samyeaman/dgconstraint")
# Then load the package in R:
library(dgconstraint)
```

- Overall

There are two broad ways to use this package:

For a single pair of lineages. Simple functions are provided that will output statistics for a given pair of lineages. These two lineages are passed to the functions as separate vectors of equal length, where each entry has information aout a given gene (or SNP, window, etc.). It is vitally importatnt in such cases that the two vectors are sorted in the same way, so that the first entry in one vector represents the same gene/SNP/window as the first entry in the second vector and so on. This approach allows you to customize calculation of C-scores, which may be more desireable when more complex designs are used that involve treatments, comparisons among combinations of lineages separated by different distances on a phylogeny, etc.

For a data set containing multiple lineages. All-in-one functions are provided that will output statistics by conducting all pairwise comparisons among the input lineages. In this case, the functions assume that the input data has lineages in columns and genes (or SNPs, windows, etc.) in rows.

The developed functions accept either continuously-distributed data, or binary data.

In all cases, the C-score and likelihood-based estimation of the number of genes that potentially contribute to adaptation require input data that provides evidence about which genes are likely involved in adaptation.

- Important notes

For continuously-distributed data, this may be in the form of p-values, Fst, GWAS-effect sizes, or other metrics, but whatever form of datam it is critical to rescale it so that larger values indicate greater evidence of adaptation. For example, for p-values, a -1 \* log10 transformation is appropriate.

For binary data, a value of 1 should be used to represent “adaptation” and a value of 0 to represent “no adaptation”.
