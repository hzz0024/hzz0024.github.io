Inspired by Sutherland et al. 2020, I'd like to identify the poential outliers under domestication selection using the thinned vcf data. Four methods will be used for data analysis. They are summarized below

| 			 |Key parameters |   Status     |  
| -----------|----------|--------------|
|   pcadapt  | K        |              |
|   BayeScan | odd      |     done     |
|    RDA     | standard deviations|              |
| Percentile | percentile|     done     |
