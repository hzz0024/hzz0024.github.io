After identifing some potential outliers using Fisher's approach, I conducted marker annotation using a program called snpeff. 

snpeff is a genetic variant annotation and functional effect prediction toolbox. It annotates and predicts the effects of genetic variants on genes and proteins (such as amino acid changes).

Features:

1) Supports over 38,000 genomes       
2) Standard ANN annotation format      
3) Cancer variants analysis      
4) GATK compatible (-o gatk)      
5) HGVS notation      
6) Sequence Ontology standardized terms
