The dataset in this post comes from the adult challenge experiment in summer, 2019. The reason I am re-analysing this dataset is due to haplotig-masked genome. An independent folder was created for this dataset - DelBay19. The major change from DelBay20 is the sample list and table. 

Before data QC, we need to create two files to provide the detailed information of sequenced samples.

sample_list.txt: sample prefix part before *_1.fastq.gz* or *_2.fastq.gz*
sample_table.txt: a tab deliminated table with the following six columns, strictly in this order:

  - `prefix` the prefix of raw fastq file names

  - `lane_number` lane number; each sequencing lane or batch should be
    assigned a unique identifier

  - `seq_id` sequence ID; this variable is only relevant when different
    libraries were prepared out of the same sample and were run in the
    same lane (e.g. if you wanted to include a replicate). In this case,
    seq\_id should be used to distinguish these separate libraries. If
    you only have a single library prepared from each of your samples
    (even if you sequence that same library across multiple lanes), you
    can just put 1 for all samples in this column.

  - `sample_id` sample ID; a unique identifier for each individual
    sequenced

  - `population` population name; the population or other relevant
    grouping variable that the individual belongs to

  - `data_type` data type; there can only be two possible entries: `pe`
    (for paired-end data) or `se` (for single end data). We need this in
    the table because for some of our processing steps, the commands are
    slightly different for paired-end and single-end data.

These two files are located at

### QC and trimming

1) First is to look at the fastqc reports:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
FASTQC=/programs/FastQC-0.11.8/fastqc
BASEDIR=/workdir/hz269/DelBay20
SAMPLELIST=$BASEDIR/sample_lists/fastq_list.txt
RAWFASTQSUFFIX1=_1.fq.gz # Suffix to raw fastq files. Use forward reads with paired-end data.

for SAMPLE in `cat $SAMPLELIST`; do

  $FASTQC $BASEDIR'/raw_fastq/'$SAMPLE$RAWFASTQSUFFIX1 -o $BASEDIR'/fastqc/'
done
```

2) Adapter clipping

Trimmomatic has lots of different filtering modules. Here I clip sequence that match to our adapter sequence (TruSeq3-PE-2.fa) and remove reads that end up being < 80bp after clipping.

```sh
cat 2_trim.sh
start=`date +%s`  ## date at start
BASEDIR=/workdir/hz269/DelBay20
TRIMMOMATIC=/programs/trimmomatic/trimmomatic-0.39.jar
SAMPLELIST=$BASEDIR/sample_lists/fastq_list_test.txt # Path to a list of prefixes of the raw fastq files. It should be a subset of the the 1st column of the sample table.
SAMPLETABLE=$BASEDIR/sample_lists/fastq_table.txt # Path to a sample table where the 1st column is the prefix of the raw fastq files. The 4th column is the sample ID, the 2nd column is the lane number, and the 3rd column is sequence ID. The combination of these three columns have to be unique. The 6th column should be data type, which is either pe or se. 
RAWFASTQDIR=$BASEDIR/raw_fastq/ # Path to raw fastq files. 
RAWFASTQSUFFIX1=_1.fq.gz # Suffix to raw fastq files. Use forward reads with paired-end data.
RAWFASTQSUFFIX2=_2.fq.gz # Suffix to raw fastq files. Use reverse reads with paired-end data. 
ADAPTERS=$BASEDIR/reference/NexteraPE-PE.fa # Path to a list of adapter/index sequences, copied from /programs/trimmomatic/adapters/

## Loop over each sample
for SAMPLEFILE in `cat $SAMPLELIST`; do
    ## Extract relevant values from a table of sample, sequencing, and lane ID (here in columns 4, 3, 2, respectively) for each sequenced library
    SAMPLE_ID=`grep -P "${SAMPLEFILE}\t" $SAMPLETABLE | cut -f 4`
    POP_ID=`grep -P "${SAMPLEFILE}\t" $SAMPLETABLE | cut -f 5`
    SEQ_ID=`grep -P "${SAMPLEFILE}\t" $SAMPLETABLE | cut -f 3`
    LANE_ID=`grep -P "${SAMPLEFILE}\t" $SAMPLETABLE | cut -f 2`
    SAMPLE_UNIQ_ID=$SAMPLE_ID'_'$POP_ID'_'$SEQ_ID'_'$LANE_ID  # When a sample has been sequenced in multiple lanes, we need to be able to identify the files from each run uniquely
    echo "Sample: $SAMPLE_UNIQ_ID"
    ## Extract data type from the sample table
    DATATYPE=`grep -P "${SAMPLEFILE}\t" $SAMPLETABLE | cut -f 6`
    
    ## The input and output path and file prefix
    RAWFASTQ_ID=$RAWFASTQDIR$SAMPLEFILE
    SAMPLEADAPT=$BASEDIR'/adapter_clipped/'$SAMPLE_UNIQ_ID
    
    ## Adapter clip the reads with Trimmomatic
    # The options for ILLUMINACLIP are: ILLUMINACLIP:<fastaWithAdaptersEtc>:<seed mismatches>:<palindrome clip threshold>:<simple clip threshold>:<minAdapterLength>:<keepBothReads>
    # The MINLENGTH drops the read if it is below the specified length in bp
    # For definitions of these options, see http://www.usadellab.org/cms/uploads/supplementary/Trimmomatic/TrimmomaticManual_V0.32.pdf
    

    if [ $DATATYPE = pe ]; then
        java -jar $TRIMMOMATIC PE -threads 1 -phred33 $RAWFASTQ_ID$RAWFASTQSUFFIX1 $RAWFASTQ_ID$RAWFASTQSUFFIX2 $SAMPLEADAPT'_adapter_clipped_f_paired.fastq.gz' $SAMPLEADAPT'_adapter_clipped_f_unpaired.fastq.gz' $SAMPLEADAPT'_adapter_clipped_r_paired.fastq.gz' $SAMPLEADAPT'_adapter_clipped_r_unpaired.fastq.gz' 'ILLUMINACLIP:'$ADAPTERS':2:30:10:1:true MINLENGTH:80' 
    
    elif [ $DATATYPE = se ]; then
        java -jar $TRIMMOMATIC SE -threads 1 -phred33 $RAWFASTQ_ID$RAWFASTQSUFFIX1 $SAMPLEADAPT'_adapter_clipped_se.fastq.gz' 'ILLUMINACLIP:'$ADAPTERS':2:30:10 MINLENGTH:40'
    fi
    
done

end=`date +%s`  ## date at end
runtime=$((end-start))
hours=$((runtime / 3600))
minutes=$(( (runtime % 3600) / 60 ))
seconds=$(( (runtime % 3600) % 60 )) 
echo "Runtime: $hours:$minutes:$seconds (hh:mm:ss)"


    ## Adapter clip the reads with Trimmomatic
    # The options for ILLUMINACLIP are: ILLUMINACLIP:<fastaWithAdaptersEtc>:<seed mismatches>:<palindrome clip threshold>:<simple clip threshold>:<minAdapterLength>:<keepBothReads>

# to run the script
nohup sh 2_trim.sh > 2_trim.log &
```

3) Build reference index files

```sh
cat 3_build_ref.sh

BASEDIR=/workdir/hz269/DelBay20
PICARD=/programs/picard-tools-2.19.2/picard.jar
SAMTOOLS=/programs/samtools-1.11/bin/samtools
BOWTIEBUILD=/programs/bowtie2-2.3.5.1-linux-x86_64/bowtie2-build
REFERENCE=$BASEDIR/reference/CV30_masked.fasta   # This is a fasta file with the reference genome sequence we will map to
REFBASENAME="${REFERENCE%.*}"
$SAMTOOLS faidx $REFERENCE

java -jar $PICARD CreateSequenceDictionary R=$REFERENCE O=$REFBASENAME'.dict'
```

4) Map to the reference, sort, and quality filter
