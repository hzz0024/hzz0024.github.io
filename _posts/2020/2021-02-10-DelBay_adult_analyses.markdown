### Depth evaluation

Table below summarize the read depth distribution for each dataset. The last column is useful for Angsd -setMaxDepth setting.

| Data       | Mean | Deviation |  SD | Mean+3SD |
|------------|------|-----------|-----|----------|
| All_441    | 1222 |   93413   | 306 |   2139   |
| CH_all_205 | 681  |   42529   | 206 |   1300   |
| DelBay19   | 739  |   42977   | 207 |   1361   |
| DelBay20   | 440  |   32848   | 181 |   983    |


All_441: dataset include all challenge (DelBay19 and 20, n=205) and wild (n=236) samples.                  
CH_all_205: dataset include all challenge (DelBay19 and 20, n=205) samples.                 
DelBay19: dataset include DelBay19 challenge (n=103) and wild samples (n=236).             
DelBay20: dataset include DelBay20 challenge samples (n=102).

|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Total number of sites analyzed           | 511494035               | 511494035             |

1) Figures above show how inversions impact the population structure patterns among challenge samples. Same as the PCA plot using all (441) samples across different batches. The third plot (after removing inversions) is generated by removing three major inverions on Chr 1, 5 and 6. 

2) The reason why I am running these PCA analyses with combined datasets is to test whether batch effect exists in the dataset. Not unexpected, the batch effect resulting from the different sequencing methods and/or read depth seperates the individuals by years.

A few questions regarding following steps:

1) the CNV inversions identifed from high-coverage WGS study is composed of more than thousand regions, should I keep removing them?

2) What is the workaround for batch effect? Using all sample may bring in the batch effect, whereas creating site files seperatly may require common shared loci identification. I prefer the latter method by generating a site file from the DelBay19 samples (including both challenge and wild, given its lower mean depth), and then use this site file to call SNPs for DelBay20 datasets. As DelBay20 challenge samples have higher mean depth, it is expected that I can capture all identifed SNPs. After that, I am going to conduct combined Fisher's exact test among individual population.

3) I noticed that PCA patters in DelBay20 challenge samples is slightly different from DelBay19, perhaps due to the different sampling strategy (the control sample in DelBay20 only include dead samples). Need further examination on this.

### Workflow

According to some pre-analyses above, here is the workflow for following data analyese.
