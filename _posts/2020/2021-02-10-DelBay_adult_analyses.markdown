### Depth evaluation

Table below summarize the read depth distribution for each dataset. The last column is useful for Angsd -setMaxDepth setting.

| Data       | Mean | Deviation |  SD | Mean+3SD |
|------------|------|-----------|-----|----------|
| All_441    | 1222 |   93413   | 306 |   2139   |
| CH_all_205 | 681  |   42529   | 206 |   1300   |

All_441: dataset include all challenge (DelBay19 and 20, n=205) and wild (n=236) samples.               
CH_all_205: dataset include all challenge (DelBay19 and 20, n=205) samples.

### Global SNP calling using different datasets 

CH_all_205:

|                                          | CH_all_205 (withinvers) | CH_all_205 (noinvers) |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Total number of sites analyzed           | 511494035               | 511494035             |
| Number of sites retained after filtering | 3839986                 | 3600542               |

1) Figures above show how inversions impact the population structure patterns among challenge samples. Note the second plot (after removing inversions) is generated by removing three major inverions on Chr 1, 5 and 6.

2) The reason why I am running these PCA analyses with combined datasets is to test whether batch effect exists in the dataset. Unfortunately but not unexpected, the batch effect resulting from the different sequencing methods and/or read depth seperates the individuals by years.

A few questions regarding following steps:

1) the CNV inversions identifed from high-coverage WGS study is composed of more than thousand regions, should I keep removing them?

2) How should proceed with site file creation? Using all sample may harbour the batch effect, whereas creating site files seperatly may require common shared loci identification.
