### Test for single-generation selection

In [Within-Generation Polygenic Selection Shapes Fitness-Related Traits across Environments in Juvenile Sea Bream](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/11/4/398/htm#app1-genes-11-00398), the author estimated the expected distribution of allele frequency changes (deltap) due to finite sample sizes in the absence of selection to generate null expectations.

### Conceptional steps:

1) a panmictic common gene pool of finite size (i.e. the real population)

2) two samples of size N1 (challenge + control, n = 98) and N2 (challenge, n = 50) are drawn within the same generation

3) compare the observed allele frequency difference - ΔP=P2-P1 with the distribution of ΔP expected from random sampling effects (i.e. due to finite sample size effects) and obtain the quantile outliers or p-values.    

### Perform the SGS test for DelBay19 challenge experiment

1) The posterior probability distribution of 𝑍 in the N1 are generated based on allele counts (k), sample size (n), and theta (sliding with 200 window-size). 

2) I use the *sample* function in the R to randomly draw a *p* (i.e. allele frequency) value based on posterior probability distribution of Z in sample N1. This *p* is used to predict the allele count in the sample size n2 (i.e. n2_k = *p* X n2 X 2, n2 = challenge group with 50 samples). 

3) The posterior probability distribution of Z in sample N2 are generated based on n2_k, n2, and the same theta.

4) The expected allele freqeuncy (p1 and p2) for N1 and N2 are drew using *sample* function, with delta_p = p2 - p1. The distribution of allele frequency differences (delta_p) between the two samples is recorded if necessary.  

5) The expected null distribution is compared to the observed value of Δp with quantile function or P-value estimation (not completed yet). A potential SNP outlier will be identified based on 99.9% quantile of the delta p distribution (two-side, positive or negative).

### Important updates compared to SGS post last week [https://hzz0024.github.io/2020/07/27/DelBay19_SGS_theta.html](https://hzz0024.github.io/2020/07/27/DelBay19_SGS_theta.html)

1) I discard the *hash* function in model as the same expected delta_p distribution will be repeatedly used for outlier detection. That is, once (n, k, n2_k, n2, theta) are same for two different SNPs, their null-distribution of delta_p will be identical (althought this is less likely to happen). This *hash* is initially designed to save the computational time. Now I just divide the total SNP list into 10 parts and run them parallelly for effeciency.

2) I double check the whole input and output files and found an important error - the observed delta_p file for outlier detection is wrongly calculated. It should be challenge - control but what I used is control - challenge. It would be easy to make mistake like this if I using a another R script (get_deltaP.R) for observed delta_p calculatioo. To prevent such mistakes in the future, I calculate the observed delta_p directly in my SGS code. Now the inputs for SGS model are just a theta and two maf (challenge and control) files. After these corrections I ran the model again. The results are shown below. 

```R
# SGS test
Rscript --verbose SGS_DelBay19.R 

# check the result

cat p_values_local.txt | wc -l
# the number of potential outliers
1182
# extract the allele frequency values from N1 and N2
python3 extract.py
# calculate the actual delta p values for 1182 SNPs
Rscript deltaP_act.R -d ~/SGS/local_theat_SGS_results -p CHR_maf0.05_pctind0.7_cv30.mafs.extracted -q CH_maf0.05_pctind0.7_cv30.mafs.extracted -t 1182 -o obs_deltap.output
```

Remained question: What is appropriate window size? It may be difficult to know without trying and comparing several (e.g. on one chromosome). How does StDev(theta) vary with window size. Maybe we want the window size where variance of theta is greatest?

Are there any common shared outliers between SGS results and wild transect comparsions? How to determine the potential SNPs of selection in the wild transect? - association analysis and same SGS model for outlier identification in wild transect.
