I will start building a framework for trans-spceific polymorphism (TSP) analysis. Before that I need to identify the synteny regions between C. virginica and C. gigas genomes. So what is synteny? Synteny usually means a set of loci in two different species which are located on the same chromosome in each, and are conserved in the same order (source: [Source: Genomics and comparative genomics](https://www.integratedbreeding.net/courses/genomics-and-comparative-genomics/www.generationcp.org/genomics/index42b0.html?page=1146)).
